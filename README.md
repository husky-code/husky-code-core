# Welcome to UW Husky Code!

Husky Code is our attempt at creating an open source, member-driven (and prettier) version of UW's PracticeIt. The idea is to take features we like from HackerRank, LeetCode, etc., and implement it on our product. We are planning on creating a full scale web application, so you can imagine we'd need any willing hands on deck. Whether you're a database expert or are just looking to play with any aspect of web development, you are in the right place! 

We will be meeting weekly during Spring Quarter on **Friday's at 10:30am** in CSE 303, so feel free to show up to a meeting and get to know the team!
